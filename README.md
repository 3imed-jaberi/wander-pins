# WanderPins ðŸ“Œ

The app will be a live geolocation app called WanderPins where users can 'pin' different locations on the map and share their own content with other users in realtime to share pictures, reviews of the location and area, interact with other users by adding comments to their pins, and manage the pins they've created.
